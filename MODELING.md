## 1. Collections Overview

Briefly describe each collection (1–2 sentences each):

- **users** —
- **projects** —
- **tasks** —
- **notes** —

---

## 2. Document Shapes

For each collection, write the document shape (field name + type + required/optional):

### users
```
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  email: string (required, unique),
  passwordHash: string (required),
  name: string (required),
  createdAt: Date (required)
}
```

### projects
```
TODO
```

### tasks
```
TODO
```

### notes
```
TODO
```

## 3. Embed vs Reference — Decisions

For each relationship, state whether you embedded or referenced, and **why** (one sentence):

| Relationship                       | Embed or Reference? | Why? |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------|------|
| Subtasks inside a task            |                     |      |
| Tags on a task                    |                     |      |
| Project → Task ownership          |                     |      |
| Note → optional Project link      |                     |      |

## 4. Schema Flexibility Example

Name one field that exists on **some** documents but not **all** in the same collection. Explain why this is acceptable (or even useful) in MongoDB.
